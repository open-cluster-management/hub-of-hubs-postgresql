The database contains a single `database` construct: `hoh`. The `hoh` database contains two schemas `spec` and `status`. 
The Hub-of-Hubs logic updates the tables in the `spec` schema, the transport logic updates tables in the `status` schema. 
Both components read tables from both schemas.

The database contains tables corresponding to the CRDs used by Hub-of-Hubs, for example `policies`, `placementrules`, `placementbindings`. 
Each table contains CRs in the `payload` field of type [jsonb](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/datatype-json.html). In addition to the `payload` field,
each table contains a [surrogate key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_key) `id` and two timestamps `created_at` and `updated_at`
that are updated automatically by the database. See [example queries](https://github.com/stolostron/hub-of-hubs-postgresql/blob/main/usage.md).
